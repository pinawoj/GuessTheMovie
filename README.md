# Guess The Movie

A simple game where the player gets to guess the movie title.

### How it works

Computer randomly picks a movie title and shows you how many letters it's made up of.</br>
Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.

If a letter is indeed in the title, the computer will reveal its correct position in the word. If not, you lose a
point.</br>

If you lose 10 points, game over!</br></br>
